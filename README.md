Unlike npm and Yarn, which create separate copies of each package for every project, pnpm uses a global store to save packages. When a package is needed for a project, pnpm creates hard links from the global store to the project's node_modules folder. This approach significantly reduces disk space usage and speeds up installation times, especially in large projects with many dependencies.
