# Package Managers

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Npm-logo.svg/640px-Npm-logo.svg.png" alt="NPM" width="300"/></a>

- ### NPM

NPM is a powerful tool that helps JavaScript developers manage and share reusable code packages called "modules". Think of it like a library for JavaScript where you can easily find, install, and use pre-written code for common tasks like making HTTP requests, working with databases, or building user interfaces. This saves developers time and effort by avoiding the need to write everything from scratch.

<a href="https://pnpm.io/" target="_blank"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=1080,height=1080,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fiorh6ftsaniq8afcuf34.png" alt="PNPM" width="300"/></a>

- ### PNPM

PNPM or "Performant Node Package Manager", is a JavaScript package manager that focuses on speed and disk space efficiency. Unlike npm and Yarn, which create separate copies of each package for every project, pnpm uses a global store to save packages. When a package is needed for a project, pnpm creates hard links from the global store to the project's node_modules folder. This approach significantly reduces disk space usage and speeds up installation times, especially in large projects with many dependencies.

<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Yarn-logo-kitten.svg/1200px-Yarn-logo-kitten.svg.png" alt="Yarn" width="300"/></a>

- ### Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that aims to improve upon npm. It focuses on speed, reliability, and security when installing and managing project dependencies. Yarn ensures consistent installations across different environments and provides features like offline caching and a global lock file to streamline the development process.
